       SAME codes — so that an alert whose polygon arrives after initial ingest

       full-county union built from SAME codes.

       **Only reached when the alert carries no polygon geometry at all**

       instead of a specific area polygon).  If ``raw_json['geometry']`` has
       coordinates but Priority 1 failed to parse them, this step is skipped so
       that a coarse county union is never substituted for a localized event.

    Uses a SAVEPOINT so that failures never corrupt the caller's session.
