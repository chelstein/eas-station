# SMS Messaging Policy

**Last updated:** March 12, 2026

This policy applies to the SMS notification feature of EAS Station. It describes how
text messages are sent, who receives them, and how recipients can opt out.

---

## Program Description

EAS Station is a self-hosted Emergency Alert System (EAS) research and monitoring
platform. When SMS notifications are enabled by the system administrator, EAS Station
sends text message alerts to pre-configured recipients whenever an EAS alert is received
and broadcast by the system.

Messages are sent via **Twilio** using a toll-free or long-code phone number provisioned
by the system operator. This is **not** a public subscription service — recipients are
added exclusively by the system administrator.

---

## Opt-In Mechanism

Because EAS Station is self-hosted software operated by a system administrator (not a
public-facing service), opt-in is managed at the operator level:

- The system administrator adds recipient phone numbers in the EAS Station admin panel
  under **Settings → Notifications → SMS Recipients**.
- Only individuals who have provided **explicit prior written consent** may be added.
- Adding a number constitutes the operator's attestation that the individual has
  consented to receive EAS alert SMS messages from this system.
- Consent must be obtained and documented **before** any messages are sent.

## Message Content

Messages contain emergency alert information in the following format:

```
EAS ALERT: [Event Code] - [Headline]
Area: [Location Codes]
Expires: [Time]
Source: EAS Station
```

Messages are kept under 160 characters for single-segment delivery.

---

## Message Frequency

Message frequency depends entirely on EAS alert volume from the National Weather Service
and other authorized government agencies.

**Message frequency varies. During active weather or emergency events, multiple messages
may be sent within a short period. During quiet periods, no messages may be sent.**

---

## Message & Data Rates

**Message and data rates may apply.** Standard SMS and data rates charged by the
recipient's mobile carrier may apply. EAS Station and its operators do not charge any
fee for SMS notifications.

---

## How to Opt Out

Reply **STOP** to any message to stop receiving SMS from this system. You will receive
a one-time confirmation and will receive no further messages from this number.

You may also contact the system operator directly and request removal of your number
from the admin panel.

| Keyword | Effect |
|---|---|
| `STOP` | Unsubscribe from all messages |
| `STOP ALL` | Unsubscribe and block all future messages |
| `HELP` | Receive help information |

## Help

Reply **HELP** to any message for assistance. You may also contact the system operator
through the contact information they have provided.

## Supported Carriers

SMS delivery is compatible with all major US wireless carriers including AT&T, T-Mobile,
Verizon Wireless, US Cellular, Boost Mobile, Cricket Wireless, and other regional and
national carriers.

!!! note
    Carriers are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages.

## Privacy

Phone numbers added to the EAS Station SMS recipient list are:

- Stored in the local EAS Station database on the **operator's** infrastructure.
- Transmitted to **Twilio, Inc.** solely for the purpose of delivering SMS messages.
- Not accessible by the EAS Station project maintainers.
