# ⚖️ Terms of Use

_Last updated: April 13, 2026_

> **Critical Safety Notice:** EAS Station is experimental software. It must not be used for life-safety, mission-critical, or FCC-mandated alerting. Commercially certified EAS equipment remains the only acceptable solution for regulatory compliance.

## 1. Project Status & Intended Use
- EAS Station is a community-driven development project currently in a pre-production, experimental phase with a roadmap focused on matching the functionality of commercial encoder/decoder hardware using off-the-shelf components.
- The reference build now leverages Raspberry Pi 5 compute modules (4 GB RAM baseline) paired with GPIO relay HATs, RS-232 interfaces, SDR receivers, and broadcast-grade audio cards. Raspberry Pi 4 hardware remains compatible for lab work, but it is no longer the documented baseline. None of these components are an approved substitute for certified encoder/decoder equipment until the software attains formal authorization.
- The codebase has been cross-checked against open-source utilities such as [multimon-ng](https://github.com/EliasOenal/multimon-ng) for decoder parity. All other logic, workflows, and documentation are original contributions from the project maintainers.
- The software is provided strictly for research, testing, and educational exploration. It is **not** a replacement for FCC-certified Emergency Alert System hardware or services and must not be relied upon for life or property protection.

## 2. No Production Deployment or Warranties
- The platform is **not** ready for production use. No representations or warranties are made about the accuracy, completeness, reliability, availability, or timeliness of the system.
- All outputs—including audio files, logs, dashboards, and reports—may contain defects or omissions. Field validation and regulatory certification have **not** been completed.
- You assume all risk for evaluating the software in lab or demonstration environments. The project is provided strictly on an “AS IS” basis without warranties of any kind.

## 3. Disclaimer of Liability & Indemnification
- To the maximum extent permitted by law, the authors, maintainers, and contributors disclaim liability for damages, penalties, data loss, downtime, enforcement actions, or claims arising from your use, misuse, deployment, or redistribution of EAS Station.
- No emergency response, broadcast activation, or public warning decision should be based on this project.
- You are solely responsible for securing your deployment, controlling access, and complying with applicable law.
- You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the project authors, maintainers, and contributors from third-party claims, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising from your deployment, operation, or misuse of the software.

## 4. Acceptable Use & Prohibited Activities
- Operate the software only in controlled, non-production lab or development environments.
- Do not present generated outputs as official alerts or public information.
- Do not connect EAS Station directly to transmitter plants, IPAWS live interfaces, dispatch systems, or any life-safety infrastructure.
- Do not use the project to transmit, relay, spoof, or interfere with authorized public warning systems or licensed broadcast facilities.
- Do not use the project for any malicious, unlawful, deceptive, surveillance, harassment, or disruptive purpose—including denial of service, spoofing, jamming, or unauthorized interception of communications.
- You are solely responsible for restricting access to your deployment and for any downstream impacts caused by third parties who use, repurpose, or chain this software into other tools.
- Retain attribution to the project and respect the licenses of any incorporated open-source dependencies.

## 4a. Criminal Liability & Federal Law Violations

> ⚠️ **Criminal Warning:** Misuse of this software may constitute one or more felonies under federal law and the laws of multiple states and jurisdictions. Ignorance of these laws is not a defense.

Misuse of EAS Station—including unauthorized broadcast, spoofing, or interference with public warning systems—may constitute serious criminal offenses under United States federal law and the laws of multiple states and jurisdictions worldwide. You acknowledge and agree that:

- **Unauthorized transmission of false Emergency Alert System signals** is a federal crime under **18 U.S.C. § 1038** (False Information and Hoaxes), punishable by up to five (5) years imprisonment per offense, plus civil penalties and restitution, for each broadcast that elicits or is likely to elicit an emergency response.
- **Willful interference with authorized Emergency Alert System broadcasts** may violate **47 U.S.C. § 325** and **47 U.S.C. § 333**, and related provisions of the Communications Act of 1934 (as amended), subject to fines of up to $100,000 per violation per day under 47 U.S.C. § 503(b), criminal prosecution under **47 U.S.C. § 501**, and forfeiture of equipment. **Critically, the $100,000 fine applies independently to each station or broadcaster that relays the signal.** Because EAS operates as an automated cascade relay network, a single conforming SAME-encoded transmission propagates automatically to every downstream participant with no further human action required. Triggering a state-level Primary Entry Point (PEP) station can force hundreds of broadcasters to re-transmit the signal simultaneously, each incurring its own separate $100,000-per-day forfeiture—potentially aggregating to tens of millions of dollars in FCC fines from a single transmission.
- **Transmission of false distress signals** is a criminal offense under **47 U.S.C. § 325(a)**, subject to criminal fines and imprisonment.
- **State and local laws** in virtually all U.S. jurisdictions impose additional criminal penalties—including felony charges—for false emergency alerts, false fire alarms, or interference with emergency communications systems. Criminal charges from multiple jurisdictions may be pursued simultaneously for a single act of misuse.
- **In Ohio specifically**, misuse of this software may additionally violate:
  - **Ohio Revised Code § 2917.31** (Inducing Panic) — prohibits initiating or circulating a false report or warning of an alleged or impending fire, explosion, crime, or other catastrophe with the purpose of causing public inconvenience or alarm, or with knowledge that such report or warning will cause public inconvenience or alarm. A violation is a **fourth-degree felony** and may be elevated depending on the harm caused.
  - **Ohio Revised Code § 2913.04** (Unauthorized Use of Computer, Cable, or Telecommunication Property) — prohibits knowingly using or accessing computer, cable, or telecommunication property—including broadcast or transmission infrastructure—without the consent of the owner or authorized user. A violation is a **fifth-degree felony** and may be elevated to a third-degree felony if the unauthorized access disrupts public services or emergency communications.
  - **Ohio Revised Code § 2909.04** (Disrupting Public Services) — prohibits knowingly disrupting, interrupting, or impairing the ability of authorized persons to receive emergency services, including radio or other communications systems used by emergency responders or public warning systems. A violation is a **fourth-degree felony**.
  - **Ohio Revised Code § 2917.32** (Making False Alarms) — prohibits initiating or announcing a false alarm of fire, explosion, flood, avalanche, or other disaster requiring emergency response, or causing another to initiate or announce such a false alarm. A violation is a **first-degree misdemeanor** and escalates to a **fourth-degree felony** if it results in serious physical harm to any person, or if the offender has a prior conviction for the same offense.
  - **Ohio Revised Code § 2921.31** (Obstructing Official Business) — prohibits knowingly hampering or impeding a public official or employee in the performance or discharge of any authorized duty. Misuse that interferes with authorized emergency broadcasts, disrupts emergency response coordination, or prevents lawful EAS relay is a violation. A violation is a **second-degree misdemeanor** and escalates to a **fifth-degree felony** when the conduct creates a risk of physical harm to any person.
- In jurisdictions outside the United States, equivalent or more severe criminal statutes may apply, and international law enforcement cooperation may result in prosecution across borders.
- To the maximum extent permitted by law, the developer, maintainers, and contributors disclaim criminal, civil, and regulatory liability for acts or omissions committed by persons using this software. You remain responsible for your own conduct and legal compliance.
- The project authors are not accomplices, aiders, or abettors of any misuse and explicitly disclaim any knowledge of, participation in, or responsibility for any illegal activity conducted using this software. The existence of this software does not constitute authorization, endorsement, or facilitation of any unlawful act.

## 4b. Documented Real-World Enforcement Cases

> EAS Station generates **valid**, standards-compliant SAME-encoded audio that has been confirmed by testing across multiple receivers to activate ENDEC hardware and software relay equipment—exactly as a live alert would. The cases below are real documented enforcement actions that arose from exactly this type of signal. They are directly applicable to any output produced by this software.

> ⚠️ **This software has not received FCC certification or regulatory approval as an EAS encoder/decoder.** EAS Station is a software-based reference implementation designed to replicate the functionality of certified hardware devices such as the Digital Alert Systems DASDEC. It is **not an approved substitute** for certified EAS encoder/decoder equipment under **47 C.F.R. Part 11** and **must not be installed anywhere within a commercial broadcast air-chain**, used by any FCC-licensed EAS Participant, or used to originate or relay alerts over any facility subject to FCC Part 11 obligations.
>
> The intended use case for this software is **licensed amateur radio operators** operating under **47 C.F.R. Part 97**, who are not FCC EAS Participants and are not subject to the Part 11 certification requirements that mandate the use of approved encoder/decoder equipment. Amateur radio operators may lawfully use EAS-compatible audio for training, experimentation, and emergency communications exercises within the scope of Part 97 and within the terms of this agreement.
>
> Understanding why this boundary is critical requires understanding how EAS relay propagation works. The Emergency Alert System was engineered for maximum geographic reach and relay reliability — not for security. Every EAS Participant station is configured by default to automatically re-broadcast any conforming SAME-encoded signal it receives. There is no cryptographic authentication, no sender verification, and no human approval gate in the relay chain. A correctly-formatted SAME header at the correct bit rate is the only credential the system evaluates. A single conforming transmission injected anywhere in the network propagates automatically and without human intervention to every downstream participant. A state-level Primary Entry Point (PEP) activation can force hundreds of broadcasters to re-transmit a false alert across an entire state in seconds — all without any human ever reviewing or approving the signal. EAS Station produces output that is indistinguishable from a live, authorized alert by the relay equipment that governs this cascade. This is not theoretical — the Montana incident (Case 3 below) is direct, documented proof.

### Case 1 — iHeartMedia / *The Bobby Bones Show*, $1,000,000 Consent Decree (2015)

iHeartMedia aired counterfeit EAS Attention Signals (the two-tone 853/960 Hz sequence) during *The Bobby Bones Show* on multiple iHeartMedia stations as part of a comedy segment. The signals were sufficiently well-formed to be intercepted as real alerts. The FCC's Enforcement Bureau initiated proceedings and iHeartMedia entered into a **Consent Decree (FCC DA 15-199)** requiring payment of a **$1,000,000 civil penalty**, adoption of a mandatory EAS compliance program, and multi-year reporting to the FCC. The decree explicitly states that broadcasting EAS tones outside authorized emergency or test use violates 47 C.F.R. § 11.45 regardless of intent.

### Case 2 — *Olympus Has Fallen* Movie Trailer, $1,900,000 Multi-Network Settlement (2014)

A theatrical trailer for the film *Olympus Has Fallen* contained EAS Attention Signals and was aired across multiple national broadcast and cable networks. The signals activated receiving equipment and constituted an unauthorized transmission under 47 C.F.R. § 11.45. The FCC issued Notices of Apparent Liability to the networks involved; the proceedings concluded in a combined **settlement of $1,900,000 (FCC DA 14-1097)** across the multiple licensees. This case established that unauthorized EAS signal transmission liability attaches to *every entity* in the distribution chain—not only the original content producer.

### Case 3 — Montana "Zombie Apocalypse" EAS Cascade Hack (January 11, 2013)

Attackers gained unauthorized access to EAS encoder/decoder hardware at KRTV-TV (Great Falls, MT) and KXLH (Helena, MT) and injected a fabricated SAME-encoded alert stating: *"Civil authorities in your area have reported that the bodies of the dead are rising from their graves and attacking the living."* Because the injected SAME headers were correctly formatted and encoded at the proper bit rate, receiving equipment throughout the Montana EAS relay network **automatically re-broadcast the message** without further human action—demonstrating the inherent cascade behavior of the EAS relay system when presented with a conforming signal. The FCC issued Public Advisory **DA 13-108** warning all EAS Participants about equipment security vulnerabilities and opened enforcement proceedings against the affected stations. The incident is cited in FCC guidance as direct evidence that properly formatted EAS signals trigger automated relay with no human gate.

### Case 4 — Ongoing FCC EAS Enforcement Pattern (2013–present)

Since 2013 the FCC Enforcement Bureau has entered into consent decrees and issued forfeiture orders against dozens of licensees for EAS tone misuse in advertisements, movie trailers, comedic content, podcasts, and streaming programming. Individual per-violation forfeitures have ranged from **$8,000 to $325,000**, and consent decree civil penalties have reached seven figures. Enforcement actions routinely include mandatory compliance programs, annual reporting obligations, and the possibility of license revocation under 47 U.S.C. § 312. All FCC enforcement records are publicly searchable at <https://www.fcc.gov/enforcement/orders>.

Applicable rules: 47 C.F.R. § 11.45 (prohibition on EAS code/Attention Signal use outside emergencies and tests); 47 U.S.C. § 503(b) (forfeiture authority up to $100,000/violation/day); 47 U.S.C. § 501 (criminal penalties up to $10,000 fine and 1 year imprisonment per violation).
