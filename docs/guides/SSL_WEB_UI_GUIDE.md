# SSL Certificate Management - Web UI Guide

## Overview

As of version 2.35.0, EAS Station provides complete SSL certificate management through the web interface. No CLI access required!

## Accessing the SSL Certificate Manager

1. Log in to your EAS Station web interface
2. Navigate to **Settings → SSL Certificates** in the top navigation menu
3. Or directly visit: `https://your-domain.com/admin/certbot`

## Features

### ✅ Configuration Tab

**Purpose:** Configure your SSL certificate settings before obtaining a certificate.

**Fields:**
- **Certbot Enabled**: Enable/disable automatic SSL certificate management
- **Domain Name**: Your fully qualified domain name (e.g., `eas.example.com`)
- **Email Address**: Email for certificate expiration notifications
- **Use Staging Server**: Toggle between production and staging (for testing)
- **Auto-Renewal Enabled**: Enable automatic certificate renewal
- **Renew Days Before Expiry**: How many days before expiration to renew (default: 30)

**Actions:**
- **Save Settings**: Apply configuration changes
- **Reset**: Reload current settings

---

### ✅ Certificate Status Tab

This tab provides four main sections:

#### 1. Certificate Status

**Purpose:** View current SSL certificate information

**Features:**
- Certificate type (Let's Encrypt, Self-Signed, or None)
- Domain name
- Issuer
- Valid until date
- Days remaining
- Status badge (Valid, Expiring Soon, or Expired)

**Actions:**
- **Check Certificate Status**: Refresh certificate information
- **Download Certificate**: Download the certificate file

#### 2. Obtain SSL Certificate

**Purpose:** Get a new SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt - **directly through the web interface**

**How it works:**
1. Click **Obtain Certificate Now**
2. Choose acquisition method:
   - **Standalone** (Recommended): Temporarily stops nginx, obtains cert, restarts nginx
   - **Nginx Plugin**: No downtime, uses nginx plugin
   - **Webroot**: Uses existing web server
3. Click **Obtain Certificate**
4. Watch real-time certbot output
5. Certificate is automatically installed

**Real-time feedback:**
- Progress indicator during execution
- Live certbot output in scrollable window
- Success/error messages with actionable guidance
- Post-installation instructions

**No CLI required!** Everything happens through the web UI.

#### 3. Domain Validation

**Purpose:** Test if your domain is properly configured for Let's Encrypt

**Tests:**
- DNS Resolution: Verifies domain resolves to correct IP
- HTTP Accessibility: Checks if port 80 is accessible (required for ACME challenge)

**Action:**
- **Test Domain**: Run both tests and see results

#### 4. Certificate Renewal

**Purpose:** Manage certificate renewal - **directly through the web interface**

**Options:**
1. **Dry Run** (Safe - No Changes)
   - Tests renewal process without making changes
   - Safe to run anytime
   - Good for testing before actual renewal

2. **Normal Renewal**
   - Renews certificates that are within 30 days of expiration
   - Skips certificates not due for renewal

3. **Force Renewal**
   - Forces immediate renewal regardless of expiration
   - Use with caution due to rate limits

**Auto-Renewal Management:**
- **Check Auto-Renewal Status**: View systemd timer status and next run time
- **Enable Auto-Renewal**: Start the certbot.timer for automatic renewal
- **Disable Auto-Renewal**: Stop automatic renewal

**Real-time feedback:**
- Progress indicator during execution
- Live certbot output
- Timer status (enabled/disabled, active/stopped, next run time)
- Success/error messages

**No CLI required!** All renewal operations through the web UI.

## Typical Workflows

### First-Time Certificate Setup

1. **Navigate** to Settings → SSL Certificates
2. **Configure** (Configuration tab):
   - Enable Certbot
   - Enter domain name
   - Enter email address
   - Leave staging disabled for production
   - Save settings
3. **Test** (Certificate Status tab):
   - Click "Test Domain"
   - Verify both DNS and HTTP tests pass
4. **Obtain** (Certificate Status tab):
   - Click "Obtain Certificate Now"
   - Choose "Standalone" method
   - Click "Obtain Certificate"
   - Wait for completion (~1-2 minutes)
5. **Verify** (Certificate Status tab):
   - Click "Check Certificate Status"
   - Confirm valid certificate is shown
6. **Enable Auto-Renewal** (Certificate Status tab):
   - Click "Manage Certificate Renewal"
   - Click "Check Auto-Renewal Status"
   - Click "Enable Auto-Renewal" if not already enabled

### Testing Renewal

1. **Navigate** to Settings → SSL Certificates → Certificate Status tab
2. Click **Manage Certificate Renewal**
3. Select **Dry Run (Test Only - No Changes)** from the dropdown
4. Click **Execute Renewal**
5. Watch the output - should show "dry run: renewing cert"
6. Verify success message

### Forcing Certificate Renewal

1. **Navigate** to Settings → SSL Certificates → Certificate Status tab
2. Click **Manage Certificate Renewal**
3. Select **Force Renewal (Renew Now)** from the dropdown
4. Click **Execute Renewal**
5. Watch the certbot output
6. Verify success and check certificate status

### Checking Auto-Renewal Status

1. **Navigate** to Settings → SSL Certificates → Certificate Status tab
2. Click **Manage Certificate Renewal**
3. Click **Check Auto-Renewal Status**
4. View:
   - Timer Enabled: Yes/No
   - Timer Active: Running/Stopped
   - Next Run: Date and time
5. Enable or disable as needed

## Security Notes

### Permissions Required

- SSL certificate operations require `system.configure` permission
- Only users with this permission can access the SSL Certificates page
- All operations are logged for audit purposes

### Safe Operations

The following operations are **safe** to run anytime:
- Check Certificate Status
- Test Domain
- Download Certificate
- Dry Run renewal test

### Operations to Use Carefully

The following operations should be used with care:
- **Obtain Certificate**: Only obtain when you need a new certificate
- **Force Renewal**: Subject to Let's Encrypt rate limits (5 per week)

### Rate Limits

Let's Encrypt has production rate limits:
- **50 certificates per registered domain per week**
- **5 failed validation attempts per account per hour**

Best practices:
1. Test with staging mode first
2. Use dry run before force renewal
3. Don't repeatedly obtain certificates unnecessarily

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Domain name is not configured"

**Solution:** Go to Configuration tab and enter your domain name, then save settings.

### "Certbot is not installed on this system"

**Solution:** Install certbot on your server:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

### "Failed to stop nginx"

**Possible causes:**
- nginx is not installed
- Insufficient permissions

**Solution:** Ensure nginx is installed and the web app has sudo privileges for systemctl commands.

### "Port 80 is not accessible"

**Possible causes:**
- Firewall blocking port 80
- Domain not pointing to your server
- Another service using port 80

**Solutions:**
1. Check firewall: `sudo ufw allow 80`
2. Verify DNS: `nslookup your-domain.com`
3. Check port usage: `sudo lsof -i :80`

### "Certbot failed" with rate limit error

**Cause:** Hit Let's Encrypt rate limits

**Solutions:**
1. Wait for rate limit reset (usually 1 hour or 1 week)
2. Use staging mode for testing
3. Avoid repeatedly requesting certificates

## Technical Details

### How It Works

When you click "Obtain Certificate" or "Execute Renewal":

1. Web UI sends POST request to backend
2. Backend validates your settings
3. Backend constructs appropriate certbot command
4. Command is executed with `subprocess` module
5. Real-time output is captured and returned
6. Results are displayed in the UI

### Commands Used

The web UI executes these certbot commands (examples):

**Obtain Certificate (Standalone):**
```bash
sudo systemctl stop nginx
sudo certbot certonly --standalone --non-interactive --agree-tos --email you@example.com -d eas.example.com
sudo systemctl start nginx
```

**Renew (Dry Run):**
```bash
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
```

**Renew (Force):**
```bash
sudo certbot renew --force-renewal
```

**Enable Auto-Renewal:**
```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now certbot.timer
```
