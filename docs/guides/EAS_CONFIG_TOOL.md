# eas-config: Interactive Configuration Tool

`eas-config` is a terminal-based configuration utility for EAS Station, similar in style to Raspberry Pi's `raspi-config`. It provides a menu-driven interface for changing common settings without requiring manual `.env` file edits, and automatically restarts services after changes are saved.

---

## Starting eas-config

The tool must be run as root:

```bash
sudo eas-config
```

If installed via the standard installer, `eas-config` is placed at `/usr/local/bin/eas-config` and available system-wide.

**Requirements:** `whiptail` must be installed (included by default on Debian/Ubuntu/Raspberry Pi OS).

```bash
# Install whiptail if missing
sudo apt-get install whiptail
```

---

## Main Menu

When you launch `eas-config`, the main menu appears:

```
 EAS Station Configuration Tool
 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 Configure your EAS Station (similar to raspi-config)

 Select an option:

   1  System Settings         (Hostname, Location, Callsign)
   2  Database Configuration  (PostgreSQL settings)
   3  Alert Sources           (NOAA, IPAWS, Manual)
   4  Audio Settings          (Receivers, Icecast, Broadcasts)
   5  Hardware Integration    (GPIO, LED Signs, VFD)
   6  Network Settings        (Firewall, Remote Access)
   7  Advanced Options        (Logging, Performance)
   8  View Current Configuration
   9  Restart Services
   0  Exit
```

Use the arrow keys to navigate and **Enter** or **Space** to select. Press **Tab** to move between buttons in dialog boxes.

## Menu Reference

### 1. System Settings

Configures core station identity settings stored in `.env`.

| Option | Environment Variable | Description |
|--------|---------------------|-------------|
| Change Hostname | `HOSTNAME` | System hostname (also updates `/etc/hostname`) |

| Poll Interval | `POLL_INTERVAL` | Seconds between feed polls (default: 60) |

---

### 4. Audio Settings

Configure audio inputs, Icecast streaming, and EAS broadcast parameters.

| Option | Variable | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|

| Option | Variable | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GPIO Enabled | `GPIO_ENABLED` | Enable/disable GPIO relay control |
| GPIO Chip | `GPIO_CHIP` | GPIO chip device (e.g., `gpiochip0`) |
| Transmit Relay Pin | `GPIO_TRANSMIT_PIN` | BCM pin number for transmitter relay |

### 8. View Current Configuration

Displays the current `.env` file contents with sensitive values masked. Use this to confirm your changes were saved correctly.

---

### 9. Restart Services

Presents a confirmation dialog, then runs:

```bash
systemctl restart eas-station.target
```

This restarts all EAS Station services in the correct order.

---

## How Changes Are Applied

1. `eas-config` reads the current value from `/opt/eas-station/.env`.
2. When you confirm a change, it updates the matching key in `.env` using a safe `awk`-based replacement.
3. New keys are appended if they do not already exist.
4. After saving, you are offered the option to restart services immediately.

Changes to database or secret key settings always require a service restart to take effect.

---

## Running Without a Terminal (SSH)

`eas-config` works over SSH with any terminal emulator that supports ncurses. Ensure your SSH client is configured to forward the terminal type:

```bash
ssh -t user@eas-station sudo eas-config
```

The `-t` flag allocates a pseudo-TTY, which is required for the whiptail interface.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "This script must be run as root"

Run with `sudo`:

```bash
sudo eas-config
```

### "whiptail is required but not installed"

```bash
sudo apt-get install whiptail
```

### Display is garbled or menus are misaligned

Set the `TERM` variable before running:

```bash
TERM=xterm sudo eas-config
```

### Changes are not taking effect

Ensure services were restarted after making changes (option 9 in the main menu, or manually):

```bash
sudo systemctl restart eas-station.target
```

### Configuration file not found

The tool expects `.env` at `/opt/eas-station/.env`. If your installation uses a different path, set the `CONFIG_FILE` variable:

```bash
CONFIG_FILE=/path/to/.env sudo eas-config
```
