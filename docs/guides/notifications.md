# Notifications — Email & SMS

EAS Station can send notifications to operators whenever an EAS alert is received and
broadcast. Two channels are supported: **email** (via SMTP) and **SMS** (via Twilio).

Both are configured in the web UI under **Settings → Notifications**.

---

## Email Notifications

### How It Works

After each EAS broadcast, EAS Station connects to the configured SMTP server and delivers
an alert summary to every address in the **EAS Alert Recipients** list. A separate list
(**Compliance / Health Alert Recipients**) receives system-health and FCC compliance
notifications.

Optionally, the full composite EAS audio (SAME header + attention tone + voice +
end-of-message) can be attached as a WAV file.

### SMTP URL Format

```
smtp://username:password@host:port?tls=true
```

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| `username` | SMTP login (some providers use `apikey` literally) |
| `password` | SMTP password or API key |
| `host` | SMTP server hostname |
| `port` | Usually `587` (STARTTLS) or `465` (TLS) |
| `?tls=true` | Append to enable STARTTLS; omit for plain / localhost |

**Localhost Postfix (no auth):**
```
smtp://localhost:25
```

### Choosing an SMTP Provider

#### Free Authenticated Relays (No Port 25 Required)

These work on any host, including Vultr, and do not require port 25 to be unblocked.
All support TLS on port 587.

| Provider | Free Limit | SMTP Host | Username | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Brevo** (Sendinblue) | 300 msg/day | `smtp-relay.brevo.com:587` | Your login email | No credit card required |
| **SendGrid** | 100 msg/day | `smtp.sendgrid.net:587` | `apikey` (literally) | Pass = API key |
| **Mailgun** | 100 msg/day (3 mo) | `smtp.mailgun.org:587` | Mailgun SMTP login | Domain verification required |
| **Resend** | 100 msg/day | `smtp.resend.com:587` | `resend` (literally) | Pass = API key |
| **SMTP2GO** | 1,000 msg/month | `mail.smtp2go.com:587` | SMTP2GO username | Good for low-volume |

For EAS Station, alert volume is typically very low (alerts are only sent on actual EAS
events), so any free tier will comfortably cover normal operation.

**Example — Brevo:**
```
smtp://your@email.com:YOUR_SMTP_KEY@smtp-relay.brevo.com:587?tls=true
```

**Example — SendGrid:**
```
smtp://apikey:SG.xxxxxxxxxxxx@smtp.sendgrid.net:587?tls=true
```

#### Self-Hosted Postfix

If you prefer to run your own mail server on the same host, see the
[Local Mail Server guide](local_mail_server.md). Once Postfix is running:

```
smtp://localhost:25
```

#### Gmail

!!! warning "App Password Required"
    Google blocks SMTP logins with your regular password. You must create an
    **App Password** under your Google Account → Security → 2-Step Verification →
    App passwords.

```
smtp://your.address@gmail.com:APP_PASSWORD@smtp.gmail.com:587?tls=true
```

#### Microsoft 365 / Outlook

```
smtp://your.address@yourdomain.com:PASSWORD@smtp.office365.com:587?tls=true
```

### Configuration Steps

1. Go to **Settings → Notifications** in the EAS Station web UI.
2. Set **Enable Email Notifications** to **Enabled**.
3. Enter your SMTP URL in the **Mail Server URL** field.
4. Add recipient addresses to **EAS Alert Recipients** (one per line).
5. Optionally add addresses to **Compliance / Health Alert Recipients**.
6. Toggle **Attach Composite Audio** if you want WAV files attached to alert emails.
7. Click **Save Settings**.
8. Use the **Send Test Email** button to verify delivery before going live.

## SMS Notifications (Twilio)

EAS Station sends SMS alerts via **Twilio**. You need a Twilio account and a purchased
phone number (toll-free or long code).

### Prerequisites

- Twilio account at [twilio.com](https://www.twilio.com/)
- A Twilio phone number (toll-free recommended for production — see below)
- Account SID and Auth Token from the Twilio Console

### Configuration Steps

1. Go to **Settings → Notifications**.
2. Set **Enable SMS Notifications** to **Enabled**.
3. Enter your **Account SID** (starts with `AC…`).
4. Enter your **Auth Token**.
5. Enter your **From Number** in E.164 format (e.g. `+18005550100`).
6. Add recipient phone numbers to **SMS Recipients** (one per line, E.164 format).
7. Click **Save Settings**.
8. Use **Send Test SMS** to verify delivery.

### Phone Number Format (E.164)

All numbers must include the country code with a leading `+`:

```
+15555551234   ← US number
+447911123456  ← UK number
```

### Toll-Free Number Verification

If you use a **toll-free number** with Twilio, US carriers require you to submit it for
verification before it can send messages at scale. Unverified toll-free numbers have
very limited throughput and may have messages blocked.

#### What Twilio Requires

Twilio's toll-free verification form asks for:

| Field | Where to Find It |
|---|---|
| Business name | Your organization name |
| Business website | Your EAS Station URL |
| Use case | "Emergency notifications / public safety alerts" |
| Opt-in page URL | `https://yourserver/sms-compliance` |
| Opt-in description | "Recipients are added by the system operator after obtaining explicit prior written consent" |
| Message sample | "EAS ALERT: Tornado Warning (TOR) issued for [County] until 6:45 PM. [Source: EAS Station]" |
| Privacy policy URL | `https://yourserver/privacy` |
| Terms of service URL | `https://yourserver/terms` |

#### Compliance Pages

EAS Station includes three public-facing compliance pages that Twilio reviewers can access:

| Page | URL | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| SMS Messaging Policy | `/sms-compliance` | Opt-in/opt-out, frequency, rates — required for verification |
| Privacy Policy | `/privacy` | Data handling, Twilio as processor |
| Terms of Use | `/terms` | Operator SMS consent obligations |

#### Submission Process

1. Log into the [Twilio Console](https://console.twilio.com/).
2. Navigate to **Phone Numbers → Manage → Active Numbers**.
3. Click your toll-free number.
4. Click **Register for A2P** or **Verify** (exact label varies by Twilio console version).
5. Complete the form using the table above.
6. Submit — Twilio typically reviews within 3–7 business days.

### Operator Consent Requirements

!!! warning "TCPA Compliance"
    You must obtain **explicit prior written consent** from every recipient before
    adding their number to EAS Station. This is a legal requirement under the
    Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) and CTIA guidelines.

    - Document consent before adding any number.
    - Honor `STOP` opt-outs immediately — Twilio processes them automatically at the
      carrier level, but you must also remove the number from the admin panel.
    - Inform recipients: "Message and data rates may apply. Message frequency varies."

See the full [SMS Messaging Policy](../policies/SMS_MESSAGING.md) for consumer-facing
disclosures.

## Recipient Management

### Email Recipients

Enter one email address per line. Two separate lists are maintained:

- **EAS Alert Recipients** — receives a notification for every EAS broadcast.
- **Compliance / Health Alert Recipients** — receives system health alerts and
  FCC compliance warnings (separate from EAS broadcast emails).

### SMS Recipients

Enter one E.164 phone number per line. All numbers receive an SMS on every EAS broadcast.

## Troubleshooting

### Test email/SMS not arriving

- Check the **Mail Server URL** format — copy it exactly from the examples above.
- For Gmail, verify you are using an **App Password**, not your account password.
- For Brevo/SendGrid, confirm the API key has sending permission.
- Check the EAS Station application log for SMTP errors:
  ```
  journalctl -u eas-station-web -f
  ```

### Emails going to spam

- Add an SPF record for your sending domain.
- Use a dedicated sending domain, not a personal Gmail address.
- For local Postfix, set up a proper PTR record — see
  [Local Mail Server](local_mail_server.md#dns-records).

### Twilio SMS not delivering

- Verify your toll-free number is registered/verified in the Twilio Console.
- Check the Twilio Console → Monitor → Logs for delivery errors.
- Confirm `sms_from_number` is in E.164 format including the country code.
- If using a trial Twilio account, you can only send to verified numbers.
