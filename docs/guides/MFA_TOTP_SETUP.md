# Multi-Factor Authentication (TOTP) Setup

EAS Station supports time-based one-time password (TOTP) multi-factor authentication for all admin accounts. Once enabled, users must enter a six-digit code from an authenticator app in addition to their password at every login.

---

## Prerequisites

- An authenticator app installed on your phone:
  - **Google Authenticator** (iOS / Android)
  - **Aegis Authenticator** (Android, open source)
  - **Raivo OTP** (iOS, open source)
  - **Microsoft Authenticator** (iOS / Android)
  - **Authy** (iOS / Android / desktop)

- Your account must be active with a valid password.

---

## Enabling MFA on Your Account

1. Log in to the EAS Station web interface.
2. Navigate to **Account → Security Settings** (top-right user menu).
3. Click **Enable Two-Factor Authentication**.
4. A QR code is displayed. Open your authenticator app and scan it.
   - If you cannot scan the QR code, tap **Enter code manually** in your app and type the key shown on screen.
5. Once the app shows a six-digit code, enter it in the **Verification Code** field and click **Verify & Enable**.
6. EAS Station verifies the code. If valid, MFA is activated immediately.
7. **Save your backup codes.** A set of 10 single-use recovery codes is displayed. Store these in a safe place — they are the only way to recover access if you lose your authenticator device.

---

## Logging In with MFA Enabled

1. Enter your username and password as normal.
2. After a successful password check, you are redirected to the MFA verification page.
3. Open your authenticator app and enter the current six-digit code.
4. The MFA verification window is **5 minutes**. If it expires, return to the login page and start again.
5. TOTP codes are valid for a **90-second window** (±1 time step) to accommodate minor clock drift. Each code can only be used once.

---

## Using a Backup Code

If you lose access to your authenticator app, enter a backup code in the MFA verification field instead of a TOTP code.

- Backup codes are 8-character alphanumeric strings (e.g., `A3F7D2B1`).
- Each backup code is single-use and is invalidated after successful entry.
- You started with 10 backup codes. Once all are used, you cannot log in without a working authenticator.

---

## Disabling MFA

1. Log in (using both password and TOTP code).
2. Navigate to **Account → Security Settings**.
3. Click **Disable Two-Factor Authentication**.
4. Confirm when prompted.
5. MFA is immediately disabled. Your TOTP secret and backup codes are deleted.

An administrator can also disable MFA for another user via **Admin → User Management → Edit User → Disable MFA**.

---

## Administrator: Enabling MFA for Other Users

1. Go to **Admin → User Management**.
2. Click **Edit** next to the target account.
3. Enable the **Require MFA** toggle if you want to force MFA at next login.
4. The user completes enrollment on their next login session.

---

## Clock Synchronization

TOTP codes are time-sensitive. If your EAS Station server clock drifts, codes may be rejected.

Verify NTP is working:

```bash
timedatectl status
```

Expected output includes `System clock synchronized: yes`. If not, enable NTP:

```bash
sudo timedatectl set-ntp true
sudo systemctl restart systemd-timesyncd
```

The system accepts codes from ±1 time step (90 seconds total window) to handle minor clock skew.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Code rejected immediately after scanning QR

- Confirm your phone's time is synchronized (Settings → Date & Time → Automatic).
- Verify you scanned the correct QR code — each enrollment generates a new secret.
- Wait for the current 30-second window to expire and try with the next code.

### "Code already used" error

EAS Station prevents the same TOTP code from being used twice within 90 seconds. Wait for the next code to appear in your authenticator app before trying again.

### Locked out (lost authenticator + backup codes)

If you have lost both your authenticator device and all backup codes, a system administrator must reset MFA via the database:

```bash
# Connect to the PostgreSQL database
psql -U eas_station -d eas_station

-- Find the user
SELECT id, username, mfa_enabled FROM admin_users;

-- Disable MFA for the affected user
UPDATE admin_users SET mfa_enabled = false, mfa_secret = null, mfa_backup_codes_hash = null WHERE username = 'affected_user';
```

Then restart the web service:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart eas-station-web
```

The user can now log in with password only and re-enroll MFA.

### MFA verification page times out

The MFA challenge session expires after 5 minutes. Return to `/login` and authenticate again from the beginning.

## Security Notes

- TOTP secrets are stored in the database; ensure the database is protected with a strong password and access controls.
- Backup codes are stored as bcrypt hashes — even with database access, plaintext codes cannot be recovered.
- Audit log entries are created for all MFA events: enrollment, successful verification, failed attempts, and backup code usage.
- Review MFA-related audit events at **Admin → Audit Logs**.
