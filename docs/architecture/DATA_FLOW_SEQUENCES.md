## Alert Processing Data Flow

This sequence shows the complete path of a CAP alert from external sources through validation, storage, spatial processing, and availability to operators.

**Key Components:**
- `poller/cap_poller.py` - Fetches and orchestrates alert processing
- `app_core/alerts.py` - Alert management and deduplication
- `app_core/boundaries.py` - Spatial geometry processing
- PostgreSQL + PostGIS - Data persistence and spatial queries

## Multi-Source Audio Ingest Data Flow (Separated Architecture)

This sequence shows how audio data from multiple sources flows through adapters in the **separated architecture** where SDR hardware is isolated.

**Key Components:**
- `sdr_hardware_service.py` - Exclusive SDR hardware access (separate systemd service)
- `eas_monitoring_service.py` - Audio processing + EAS monitoring (separate systemd service)
- `app_core/audio/redis_sdr_adapter.py` - Redis SDR subscriber
- `app_core/audio/sources.py` - Other source adapters
- `app_core/audio/ingest.py` - AudioIngestController

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant SDR_HW as sdr-hardware-service<br>(USB access)
    participant Redis as Redis Pub/Sub<br>sdr:samples:{id}
    participant RedisAdapter as RedisSDRSourceAdapter<br>redis_sdr_adapter.py

    participant Controller as AudioIngestController<br>ingest.py
    participant BroadcastQ as Per-Source<br>BroadcastQueues
    participant EAS_Mon as Per-Source<br>EAS Monitors

    Note over SDR_HW,EAS_Mon: Separated Architecture - NO shared hardware access

    par SDR Hardware Service (separate systemd service)
        SDR_HW->>SDR_HW: RadioManager.start_all()
        loop For each receiver (LP1, LP2, SP1)
            SDR_HW->>SDR_HW: Receiver.get_samples() → IQ samples
            SDR_HW->>SDR_HW: Compress + base64 encode

            SDR_HW->>Redis: PUBLISH sdr:samples:SP1 {iq_data}
        end
    and EAS Monitoring Service (separate systemd service)
        Note over RedisAdapter: Subscribes to Redis channels
        RedisAdapter->>Redis: SUBSCRIBE sdr:samples:LP1
        RedisAdapter->>Redis: SUBSCRIBE sdr:samples:LP2
        RedisAdapter->>Redis: SUBSCRIBE sdr:samples:SP3
        
        loop Receive IQ samples via Redis
            Redis-->>RedisAdapter: IQ samples (compressed)
            RedisAdapter->>RedisAdapter: Decompress + decode
            RedisAdapter->>RedisAdapter: Demodulate IQ → Audio (FM/AM)
            RedisAdapter->>Controller: Audio PCM chunks
        end
    and HTTP Stream Sources
        loop Stream ingestion
            Streams-->>StreamAdapter: HTTP chunks (MP3/AAC)
            StreamAdapter->>StreamAdapter: Decode → PCM
            StreamAdapter->>StreamAdapter: Resample
            StreamAdapter->>Controller: Audio PCM chunks
        end
    end

    Note over Controller: Each source publishes to its own BroadcastQueue
    
    loop For each source
        Controller->>BroadcastQ: Source → BroadcastQueue (independent)
        BroadcastQ->>EAS_Mon: Each monitor subscribes to one queue
    end
    
    Note over EAS_Mon: ALL sources monitored simultaneously (not just highest priority)
```

**Critical Architecture Changes (v2.16.0):**

1. **SDR Hardware Separation**: 
   - SDR hardware access ONLY in `sdr-hardware-service.py` (separate systemd service with USB access)
   - No RadioManager in `eas-monitoring-service.py`
   - Communication via Redis pub/sub: `sdr:samples:{receiver_id}`

2. **Per-Source EAS Monitoring**:
   - Each source has its own BroadcastQueue
   - Each source has its own EAS monitor instance
   - ALL sources monitored simultaneously (not priority-based selection)
   - Fixed bug where only highest-priority source was monitored

3. **Data Transformations:**
   - **IQ samples (SDR)**: Complex → Demodulated PCM (FM/AM/NFM)
   - **HTTP streams**: Compressed (MP3/AAC) → PCM
   - **All sources**: Variable rate → Configured rate (16-48 kHz)
   - **PCM samples → dB levels**: Peak/RMS for metering
   - **Audio chunks → Per-source queues**: Independent broadcast queues

**Service Files:**
- `sdr_hardware_service.py` - SDR hardware operations (was: sdr_service.py)
- `eas_monitoring_service.py` - Audio processing + EAS monitoring (was: audio_service.py)
- `app_core/audio/redis_sdr_adapter.py` - Redis IQ sample subscriber
- `app_core/audio/ingest.py` - Audio controller with per-source queues

**Complete Data Path:**
1. **CAP XML** (NOAA) → **CAPAlert record** (Database)
2. **CAPAlert** → **SAME header string** (EAS Generator)
3. **SAME header** → **FSK audio** (FSK Encoder)
4. **FSK + TTS + Tones** → **Complete WAV file** (Audio Builder)
5. **WAV file** → **RF signal** (Transmitter)
6. **RF signal** → **IQ samples** (SDR Receivers)
7. **IQ samples** → **Demodulated audio** (FM Demodulator)
8. **Demodulated audio** → **Decoded SAME header** (Verification)
9. **Decoded vs. Original** → **Verification record** (Database)

**Timeline:** Complete flow typically takes 60-120 seconds from alert fetch to verified broadcast.

**Files:** Multiple components across entire codebase

## Summary

These sequence diagrams illustrate the major data processing paths through the EAS Station system:

1. **Alert Processing** - CAP alerts flow from external sources through validation and spatial processing to storage
2. **SDR Monitoring** - RF signals are continuously converted to digital samples and monitored for quality
3. **Audio Ingest** - Multiple audio sources flow through adapters into a unified controller with priority selection
4. **Radio Capture** - Broadcast triggers coordinated capture across all receivers for verification
5. **EAS Generation** - Alert data transforms through SAME encoding, FSK modulation, and audio assembly
6. **Complete Pipeline** - End-to-end flow from CAP fetch to verified broadcast

Each diagram shows:
- **Components involved** with file references
- **Data transformations** at each step
- **Decision points** and error handling
- **Timing and synchronization** between components

**Key Insights:**
- Data flows through well-defined layers with clear transformations
- Spatial processing (PostGIS) is critical for alert relevance
- Radio captures are coordinated but operate independently
- Verification closes the loop by comparing transmitted vs. received data
- The system maintains comprehensive audit trails at each stage
