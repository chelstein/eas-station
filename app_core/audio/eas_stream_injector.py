EAS Stream Injector

Publishes generated EAS alert audio directly into the active source
BroadcastQueue(s) so that every subscribed IcecastStreamer streams
the full SAME sequence (headers → attention tone → narration → EOM)
to listeners on the Icecast server.

Usage
-----
At app startup (after AudioIngestController is created)::

    from app_core.audio import eas_stream_injector
    eas_stream_injector.set_controller(controller)

When an EAS broadcast is generated::

    from app_core.audio.eas_stream_injector import inject_eas_audio
    inject_eas_audio(wav_bytes)

The injector converts WAV bytes to float32 PCM, resamples to each
source's native rate, and publishes in 50 ms chunks to the source's
BroadcastQueue.  IcecastStreamer reads those chunks and sends them on
to the Icecast server without any additional wiring.
