Multi-Worker Coordinator for Audio Processing

Ensures only ONE worker across all Gunicorn processes handles audio ingestion
and EAS monitoring, while all workers can serve UI requests by reading shared state.

Architecture:
    Master Worker: Runs audio controller, broadcast pump, EAS monitor
    Slave Workers: Serve UI requests by reading shared metrics

Coordination Strategy (with automatic fallback):
    1. Try Redis-based coordination (preferred, robust, fast)
    2. Fall back to file-based if Redis unavailable

Redis Mode:
    - Distributed locks with TTL (automatic failover)
    - In-memory state (100x faster than files)
    - Pub/Sub for real-time updates
    - Atomic operations (no race conditions)
