Audio Ingest Pipeline and Playout Queue for EAS Station

This module provides unified audio capture from multiple sources including
SDR receivers, ALSA/PulseAudio devices, and file inputs with standardized
metering, monitoring, and diagnostics capabilities.

It also includes the audio playout queue system with FCC-compliant precedence
logic per 47 CFR Part 11, and the audio output service for deterministic playback.
