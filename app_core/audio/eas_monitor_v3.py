Unified EAS Monitor Service - V3 Architecture

CRITICAL REDESIGN: Single-threaded unified monitor service that addresses
inefficiencies in the multi-monitor architecture.

Previous Architecture (V2):
- N separate monitor threads (one per audio source)
- Manual monitor lifecycle management (add/remove monitors)
- Status aggregation overhead on every API call
- Duplicate resources (N resampling adapters, N health trackers)
- Tight coupling to audio source lifecycle

New Architecture (V3):
- Single monitor thread for ALL audio sources
- Auto-discovery of running sources
- Centralized health tracking
- Shared SAME decoder for all sources
- Lightweight per-source watchers (no threads)

Benefits:
- 1 thread instead of N threads → reduced CPU/memory
- No manual lifecycle management → simpler code
- Direct status access → no aggregation overhead
- Centralized health → consistent tracking
- Auto-discovery → decoupled from source lifecycle

Architecture:

    UnifiedEASMonitorService (1 thread)
    ├── SourceWatcher[LP1] (subscribes to LP1 broadcast queue)
    ├── SourceWatcher[LP2] (subscribes to LP2 broadcast queue)
    ├── SourceWatcher[SP1] (subscribes to SP1 broadcast queue)
    ├── HealthTracker (centralized health for all sources)
    └── StreamingSAMEDecoder (shared decoder processing all sources)

Usage:
    from app_core.audio.eas_monitor_v3 import UnifiedEASMonitorService
    
    # Initialize with audio controller reference
    monitor = UnifiedEASMonitorService(
        audio_controller=audio_controller,
        alert_callback=my_alert_handler,
        configured_fips_codes=['012345', '067890']
    )
    
    # Start unified monitor (auto-discovers sources)
    monitor.start()
    
    # Get status (no aggregation needed)
    status = monitor.get_status()
    
    # Stop when done
    monitor.stop()
