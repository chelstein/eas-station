EAS Monitoring Startup Integration

Audio Sources → Controller → Adapter → Monitor → Decoder → Database

This module should be called during Flask app initialization to enable
continuous SAME monitoring.

    Initialize and start the complete EAS monitoring system.

    This function:
    1. Checks if audio processing should run in this service
    2. Tries to acquire master worker lock (multi-worker coordination)
    3. Gets the global AudioIngestController (master only)
    4. Creates an alert callback for processing detections
    5. Initializes the EAS monitor with adapter
    6. Auto-starts continuous monitoring

    Service Architecture:
    - Separated: Audio service runs audio processing, web app reads from Redis
    - Integrated: Web app runs everything (with master/slave worker coordination)

    Returns:
        True if successfully initialized and started

    Should be called during Flask app startup (in initialize_database or similar).
