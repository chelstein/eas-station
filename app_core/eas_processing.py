    Process a received EAS alert that matched configured FIPS codes.

    This function is called by the monitoring system after an alert has been:
    1. Detected via SAME decoder
    2. Filtered by FIPS codes
    3. Stored in ReceivedEASAlert table

    Args:
        alert: EASAlert object from continuous monitor

    Returns:
        Dict with processing results, or None if processing failed

    Processing steps:
    1. Extract alert metadata
    2. Generate EAS message (if needed)
    3. Trigger notifications
    4. Return message ID for linking
