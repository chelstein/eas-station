Unit tests for CAP poller continuous mode behavior.

Tests verify that the continuous polling loop:
1. Does not hammer the CPU with tight loops
2. Does not flood NOAA/IPAWS APIs with rapid requests
3. Implements proper exponential backoff on errors
4. Ensures minimum interval between polling attempts
