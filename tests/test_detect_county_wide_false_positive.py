# Regression tests for the _detect_county_wide false-positive bug.
#
# The county_and_state heuristic previously matched any alert that
# contained the generic word "county" and the configured state name,
# regardless of which county the alert targeted.
#
# For a station in Putnam County, Ohio an alert for "Henry County, Ohio"
# would contain both "county" (generic) and "ohio" (state code), and was
# therefore incorrectly flagged as county-wide.
#
# The fix: county_short must also appear in area_lower before the
# heuristic fires.
